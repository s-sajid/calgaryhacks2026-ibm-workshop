              "#### 🎯 **Why This Wins**  \n",
              "- **Hyper-Local Impact**: Calgary has **1 in 8 residents** facing food insecurity (Calgary Food Bank data). Food banks like **Calgary Food Bank** and **Second Harvest** are overwhelmed with manual sorting—wasting hours on categorizing canned goods, fresh produce, and perishables.  \n",
              "- **Unique Twist**: Instead of just \"another donation app,\" we use **on-device AI** to instantly identify items via phone camera (e.g., \"canned tomatoes,\" \"milk carton,\" \"expired yogurt\"), then auto-sort them into categories and flag spoilage risks. No cloud dependency = works offline in low-connectivity areas.  \n",
              "- **Calgary-Specific Flair**: Integrates with **local grocery partnerships** (e.g., Sobeys, Safeway) to predict incoming donations based on surplus data—so food banks can plan ahead for high-demand items (like fresh produce during summer heatwaves).  \n",
              "- **Technical Wow Factor**:  \n",
              "  - Train a **tiny ML model** (TensorFlow Lite) on common food items using free datasets (e.g., USDA Food Database).  \n",
              "  - Build a **simple Android app** with camera scan → AI classification → dashboard for managers.  \n",
              "  - Add a **\"Donation Pulse\"** feature: Real-time heatmaps showing which neighborhoods need donations most (using anonymized data from shelters).  \n",
              "- **24-Hour Feasibility**:  \n",
              "  - Use pre-trained models (e.g., Teachable Machine for image classification).  \n",
              "  - Build a prototype in 4 hours: Camera UI → basic classification → Firebase dashboard.  \n",

              "- **Social Impact**: Directly helps vulnerable Calgarians—judges prioritize projects with tangible community benefits.  \n",
              "- **Innovation**: Combines edge AI + local data in a way no existing tool does (most \"food waste\" apps focus on restaurants, not food banks).  \n",
