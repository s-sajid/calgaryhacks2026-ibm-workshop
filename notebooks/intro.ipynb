Judges don’t just look for \"cool tech\"—they want **real-world impact, local relevance, and a story that sticks with them**.

              "  Calgary has over **100,000 buildings built before 2000**—many are energy hogs. The city’s *Net Zero by 2050* plan needs solutions *now*, but retrofitting is expensive and confusing for homeowners. Existing tools are either too technical (for engineers) or too generic (like \"turn off lights\").  \n",
              "- **The Twist**:  \n",
              "  We’re not just another energy app. **EcoPulse uses AI to turn public data into hyper-local, actionable steps**—like \"Your 1970s bungalow in Inglewood could save $300/year by replacing this window *and* adding attic insulation.\" It’s built for **homeowners, not experts**, with plain English advice.  \n",

              "  - ✅ **Uses real public data**: Leverages the [City of Calgary’s Open Data Portal](https://data.calgary.ca/) (e.g., building age, energy reports, neighborhood maps).  \n",
              "  - ✅ **Simple but powerful tech**: A web app with a map interface + AI recommendations (using lightweight ML like TensorFlow.js—no heavy cloud costs!).  \n",
